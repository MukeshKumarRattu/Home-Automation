# Home Automation
Want to control your house lights or add some automation functionality then you can easily use ESP8266 and Blynk app which is easy to use and hence can be easily installed by anyone as DIY project.

# Parts Required
Lets get started what we will need for this automation:

NodeMCU (I have purchased from banggood.in), you can use any other board which gives wifi functionality like wemos
Mobile Phone (To control blynk app)
5v Relay (I have 2 channel relay - You can use any number of relay upto which your board can give output)
3.3v - 5v Breadboard powersupply
12v powersupply (Any 12v prefered more than 1A like LED Strip Driver)
Connecting wires, jumper wires, heat shrinks, screwdrivers and blah blah (Basic tools that are required for any project)
